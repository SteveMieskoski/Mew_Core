NOTES REGARDING THIS DIRECTORY:
ledger implementation of hardware wallet functions mostly.  it does not error (browser support needs to be off when using node), and the demo.js in the ledger directory returns the first address. however, much of the setup seems to be fragile and that makes me concerned.

- test/ledgerTest.js completes without errors, but I am not happy with this implementation as:
 1. It relies heavily on Metamask/provider-engine directly
 2. It is too callback/nested async heavy and this is causing deep nesting of functions
 -- Reimplemented and It is much better (current Implementation)



- Web3 is depending on obscure libraries
